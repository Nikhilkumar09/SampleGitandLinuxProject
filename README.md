# SampleGitandLinuxProject
This is to practice and demonstrate basic skills of Linux and Git .

Project Description :

Overview:

The Git Skills Test - Collaborative Text File project is a hands-on exercise designed to evaluate your proficiency with Git, the version control system widely used for collaborative software development. 

In this project, you will work with a simple text file, 
demonstrating your ability to create branches, make changes, resolve conflicts, and collaborate with others in a Git-based environment.

Project Goals:

1.Git Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with Git by performing basic version control operations such as cloning, branching, committing, and merging.
2.Collaboration: Simulate a collaborative workflow by making changes to a shared shell script file and managing potential conflicts when multiple contributors make changes concurrently.
3.Documentation: Practice good Git habits by creating informative commit messages and keeping a concise project README.


Features:

The Collaborative Text File project will include the following features:

1.Repository Setup: A Git repository will be created, containing a shared shell script file.

2.Collaborative Editing: You and other contributors (real or simulated) will make changes to the file on separate branches.

3.Branch Merging: You will merge changes from multiple branches, resolving any conflicts that arise.

4.Commit Messages: Detailed commit messages will be required for each change made.

How to Use:

1.Clone the Repository: Use git clone to create a local copy of the Git repository for this project.
2.Create Your Branch: Create a new branch for yourself using git checkout -b your-branch-name.
3.Make Changes: Edit the file in your branch and commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.
4.Simulate Collaboration: Invite other contributors (or use multiple terminal instances) to make changes on their branches simultaneously.
5.Branch Merging: Merge changes from different branches into the main branch, resolving any conflicts as necessary.
6.Document Your Work: Update the README file in the repository with information about your contributions.

Skills to Test:

•Cloning a Git repository.
•Creating and switching between branches.
•Testing out creating a Linux shell script
•Making changes, committing, and pushing to remote branches.
•Resolving merge conflicts.
•Creating informative commit messages.
•Collaborative Git workflow.

Extensions:

To challenge yourself further, consider adding the following advanced features:
•Implement a review process where changes must be approved before merging.

Conclusion:

The Git Skills Test - Collaborative Text File project offers a practical opportunity to showcase your Git skills and understanding of collaborative version control. 
By successfully completing this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to work effectively with Git in a team environment and manage version control for collaborative coding projects
