# SampleGitandLinuxProject
This is to practice and demonstrate basic skills of Linux and Git .

Project Description :

**Overview:**

The Git Skills Test - Collaborative Text File project is a hands-on exercise designed to evaluate your proficiency with Git, the version control system widely used for collaborative software development. 

In this project, you will work with a simple text file, 
demonstrating your ability to create branches, make changes, resolve conflicts, and collaborate with others in a Git-based environment.

**Project Goals:**

1.Git Fundamentals: Gain practical experience with Git by performing basic version control operations such as cloning, branching, committing, and merging.

2.Collaboration: Simulate a collaborative workflow by making changes to a shared shell script file and managing potential conflicts when multiple contributors make changes concurrently.

3.Documentation: Practice good Git habits by creating informative commit messages and keeping a concise project README.


**Project Guidlines**

**1. Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new Git repository either locally or on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
   - Add a shared shell script file (e.g., `shared-script.sh`) to the repository.

**2. Collaborative Editing:**
   - Each contributor should clone the repository using `git clone`.
   - Contributors should create their own branches using `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
   - Edit the `shared-script.sh` file in your branch with your changes.
   - Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages using `git commit`.

**3. Branch Merging:**
   - To merge changes from multiple branches into the main branch, use `git checkout main` to switch to the main branch.
   - Then use `git merge your-branch-name` to merge changes from a specific branch into the main branch.
   - If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. You can use a text editor to manually resolve conflicts.
   - After resolving conflicts, commit the changes again.

**4. Commit Messages:**
   - Make sure to provide detailed commit messages that describe the purpose and content of each commit. Use `git commit -m "Your commit message here"` to commit.


**5. Simulate Collaboration:**
   - Invite other contributors to clone the repository and create their own branches.
   - Each contributor can make changes in their branches simultaneously.
